## REST API
A very simple API made with the Flask framework which for now enables us to retrieve and send the latitude and longitude
of the drone by means of HTTP methods such as GET and POST

## Examples and tutorials
The API Rest module has been build using the Flask framework. A very simple and clear example on how to use Flask
(in Spanish) can be found here:
